A simple Node.Js app. Click on the pizza cards to grab the ingredients from a local server using node

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, API

Simple styles and simple JS. Created my very own API within node. Added event listeners to grab the card that's clicked and used Node to send data back to the DOM.

## Lessons Learned:

My focus was on understanding raw Node.js. No frameworks used to get and post data.
I was also focused on learning how to create my own API on a local server. This was a simple project to understand the fundamentals before moving on to using Express. Node.js is just another tool that can take my website to the next level.
